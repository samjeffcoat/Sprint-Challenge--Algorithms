#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear Time- O(n). As n increases, our run time will increase. As n decreases, our run time decreases. For example if n is 1 then the run time will be much smaller than if n is 10. 


b)O(n^3). There are 3 operations being performed in this equation. We are establishing j in the first loop, multiplying j by 2, then we are also incrementing sum within the last loop. This is a inefficient program. 


c)
